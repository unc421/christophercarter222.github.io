		I am a PhD candidate in Political Science and Research Associate at the Center on the Politics of Development at the University of California, Berkeley.  
		My research agenda seeks to understand the causes and consequences of local revenue shortfalls in Latin America. 
		My dissertation project investigates when and how resource-constrained elected officials incorporate traditional 
		economic institutions into the state as a way of providing public goods. Other work addresses the role of political 
		parties in determining local officials' access to national government revenue.  An ongoing project uses a field experiment 
		in Peru to determine how different types of information shape the decisions of mayors to apply for central government funds.  
		All of my work employs a multi-method approach, using experimental and quasi-experimental data as well as extensive interviewing. </p>
	
	<p> Prior to coming to Berkeley, I completed a Master's in Latin American Studies at the University of Cambridge as a 
		Gates-Cambridge scholar.  I also hold a B.A. in Political Science and History from the University of North Carolina at 
		Chapel Hill, where I studied as a Morehead-Cain scholar.  </p>
